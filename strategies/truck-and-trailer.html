          The truck and trailer strategy is an attacking strategy that involves
          pre-defining roles at the breakdown in order to speed up the time
          taken to execute a roll ball. As each roll ball requires the defense
          to get back 7m, a faster roll ball can leave defenders still running
          backward, or even left offside, when the next phase begins.
          Continuously pushing the defence to have to recover quickly over a
          series of phases can safely win yards, ease the pressure from an
          aggressive defence and draw defenders into the center.

          Here is an example breakdown, where A has been previously tagged. B is
          the dummy half (going to pick up the ball) and is going to pass to C
          as first receiver, with D outside them.
        </div>
        <div class="page-paragaph">
          At this point, C initiates the strategy by conferring with D. Between
          them they devise that C will be the “Truck” and D will be the
          “Trailer”. D moves to stand behind C.

          The “Truck” will call for a short ball from the dummy half (B) and
          will try to time their run so they are running when they receive the
          ball. Their aim is to make a decent amount of yards and engage the
          defence, but they are not actively trying to break the line.
        </div>
        <div class="page-paragaph">
          The “Trailer” will follow a few yards behind, ready to pick up the
          ball once the truck has been tagged.

          Approaching the defensive line, the truck must been seen to be making
          some attempt to evade the defender, or else they might penalized for
          surrendering.

        <div class="page-paragaph">
          When the truck gets tagged, the key is speed. No over-running thinking
          you may not have been tagged! The moment you are sure that you’ve been
          tagged, put the ball between your legs and trust that your trusty
          trailer is ready and waiting.
        </div>
        <div class="page-paragaph">
          Whilst the first “pod” (C and D), are doing the first phase of truck
          and trailer. The second “pod” (A and B) have had enough time to confer
          about whether they wish to continue truck and trailering. If they do,
          B (the previous dummy half) is typically in the best position to take
          the ball as truck. They should call clearly which side they wish to
          attack, as they should be able to attack either side. They need to
          time their run carefully; whilst being fast is good, it’s easy to
          overrun the dummy half (D) if they’re not quite ready to pass yet.

          This strategy can be continued for 3 or 4 phases if desired, with the
          same 2 pods circulating. I imagine it can make a fairly easy training
          exercise to just run 4 attacking players up the pitch, going back and
          forth between the 2 pods until they are used to this enough to commit
          to it in a game.

        <div class="page-paragaph">
          Typically this strategy would be more useful when in our own half
          where we don’t want to do anything particularly risky. Or when it’s
          wet and we can’t really make very many wide passes. It’s not intended
          to be used all the time, just a tool to have. As such, it’s imperative
          to have clear communication so that everyone knows what’s happening.
          Lots of shouting!
